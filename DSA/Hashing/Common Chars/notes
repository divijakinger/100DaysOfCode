# Common Chars
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-common-characters/

1. Initialize a HashMap called **`min_frequency`** to store the minimum frequency of each character from 'a' to 'z'. Set the initial value for each character as 1000.
2. Iterate over the array of words.
    - Create a new HashMap called **`curr_frequency`** to store the frequency of characters in the current word.
    - Iterate over each character in the current word.
        - Update the frequency of the character in **`curr_frequency`**.
    - Compare the frequencies of each character in **`curr_frequency`** with the corresponding frequencies in **`min_frequency`**. Update **`min_frequency`** with the minimum value for each character.
3. Create an empty list called **`ans`** to store the common characters.
4. Iterate over each character from 'a' to 'z'.
    - While the frequency of the character in **`min_frequency`** is greater than 0 and less than 1000:
        - Add the character to the **`ans`** list.
        - Decrease the frequency of the character in **`min_frequency`** by 1.
5. Return the **`ans`** list containing the common characters.
