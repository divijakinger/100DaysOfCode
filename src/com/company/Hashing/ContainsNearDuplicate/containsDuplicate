1.Create an empty HashSet called set to store unique elements.
2.Iterate over the array arr from index 0 to the end.
3.If the current element arr[i] is already present in the set, return true (indicating the presence of a nearby duplicate).
4.Add the current element arr[i] to the set.
5.If the current index i is greater than or equal to k, remove the element at index i - k from the set to maintain a sliding window of size k.
6.Return false if no nearby duplicates are found.
